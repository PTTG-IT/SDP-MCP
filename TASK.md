## Notes

### API Limitations Discovered
- Rate limit is actually 60 requests per minute per endpoint
- Some fields require specific formats not documented
- Pagination max is 100, not 200 as initially thought

### Dependencies to Update
- Check for axios security updates
- Update to latest MCP SDK when available
- Review all dependencies quarterly

### Future Considerations
- Consider GraphQL wrapper for REST API
- Evaluate WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Research Service Desk Plus mobile API differences
