# Context Engineering Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully transformed the Service Desk Plus Cloud API project into a context-engineered project following the established standards.

## Added Context Engineering Components

### 1. **.claude Directory**
- **`.claude/commands/`**: Custom AI commands
  - `generate-prp.md`: Generates Product Requirements Prompts from feature requests
  - `execute-prp.md`: Executes PRPs to implement features with validation
- **`.claude/settings.local.json`**: Permission settings for:
  - npm/yarn/node commands
  - TypeScript compilation
  - ESLint/Prettier
  - Web fetching for SDP and MCP documentation

### 2. **Core Context Files**

#### CLAUDE.md
Comprehensive AI assistant guidelines including:
- Project awareness rules (read PLANNING.md, check TASK.md)
- Code structure guidelines (500 line limit, module organization)
- TypeScript and testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Security practices
- Development workflow

#### PLANNING.md
Detailed architecture documentation:
- System architecture diagram
- Code structure overview
- Technical stack details
- Design patterns (Repository, DI, Error Handling)
- API coverage status
- Constraints and limitations
- Future enhancements roadmap

#### TASK.md
Active task tracking with:
- Current sprint items
- Completed tasks with timestamps
- Backlog prioritization
- Bug fixes and technical debt
- Implementation notes

#### INITIAL.md
Feature request template with sections for:
- Feature description
- Code examples to follow
- Documentation references
- Other considerations (rate limiting, auth, testing)
- Acceptance criteria

### 3. **PRPs Directory**
- **`PRPs/templates/prp_base.md`**: Base template for generating PRPs
- **`PRPs/README.md`**: Guide for using PRPs
- Space for generated feature PRPs

### 4. **Enhanced Documentation**
Updated README.md with:
- Quick start section for context engineering
- Context engineering workflow explanation
- Updated project structure showing context files
- Contributing guidelines using context engineering

## Context Engineering Workflow

The project now follows this workflow:

```
1. Feature Request → INITIAL.md
2. Generate PRP → /generate-prp command
3. Review PRP → PRPs/[feature].md
4. Execute → /execute-prp [feature].md
5. Track → Update TASK.md
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **AI Understanding**: Claude can quickly understand project structure and conventions
2. **Consistent Implementation**: PRPs ensure features follow established patterns
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and testing requirements
4. **Knowledge Preservation**: Architecture decisions documented in PLANNING.md
5. **Task Visibility**: Clear tracking of work in TASK.md

## Key Guidelines for AI Assistants

1. Always start by reading PLANNING.md
2. Check TASK.md before beginning work
3. Follow patterns in existing code
4. Maintain 500-line file limit
5. Use TypeScript strict mode
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Update documentation

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for context-engineered development:

1. Create feature requests in INITIAL.md
2. Use AI assistants to generate and execute PRPs
3. Track progress in TASK.md
4. Maintain high code quality standards
5. Keep documentation current

The Service Desk Plus Cloud API project is now fully equipped with context engineering, enabling efficient and consistent development with AI assistance.
