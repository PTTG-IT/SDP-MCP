# ✅ SDP MCP Server is READY

## Current Status: RUNNING ✅

**Server Address**: `http://192.168.2.10:3456/sse`  
**Health Check**: `http://192.168.2.10:3456/health` ✅ OK  
**Port 3456**: ✅ LISTENING  

## For the Remote Client

The MCP server is now running and ready for connections. Use this configuration in your Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "service-desk-plus": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://192.168.2.10:3456/sse",
        "--allow-http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools (Based on Previous Working Implementation)

✅ **list_requests** - List service desk requests with optional filters  
✅ **get_request** - Get details of a specific request by ID  
✅ **search_requests** - Search requests by subject or other criteria  
✅ **get_metadata** - Get metadata (priorities, statuses, categories, etc.)  

## Server Endpoints

- **Primary**: `http://192.168.2.10:3456/sse` 
- **Alternative**: `http://studio:3456/sse`
- **Alternative**: `http://studio.pttg.loc:3456/sse`
- **Alternative**: `http://10.212.0.7:3456/sse`

## Test Connection

From your client machine:
```bash
curl http://192.168.2.10:3456/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"ok","service":"sdp-mcp-server","version":"1.0.0","environment":"development"}
```

## Server Management

**To restart the server:**
```bash
cd /Users/kalten/projects/SDP-MCP/sdp-mcp-server
./start-simple.sh
```

**To stop the server:**
```bash
pkill -f "simple-sse-server"
```

**To check if running:**
```bash
lsof -i :3456
curl http://192.168.2.10:3456/health
```

## Next Steps for Client

1. **Update Claude Desktop config** with the JSON above
2. **Restart Claude Desktop completely** (quit and restart)
3. **Look for tools** - You should see Service Desk Plus tools in Claude
4. **Test with a simple request**: "List the latest service desk requests"

The server implements the exact same tools that were working in the previous version, so you should have immediate functionality for:
- Listing requests
- Getting specific request details  
- Searching requests
- Retrieving metadata

## Troubleshooting

If you can't connect:
- Verify the health endpoint works: `curl http://192.168.2.10:3456/health`
- Check that Claude Desktop config is correct
- Ensure Claude Desktop was completely restarted
- Try using a different server address (studio, studio.pttg.loc, etc.)

The server logs all connections and API calls, so any issues will be visible in the console output.
