## üöß In Progress / Planned Features

### High Priority
- [ ] **Asset Management Module**
  - Asset CRUD operations
  - Asset assignment and tracking
  - Asset lifecycle management
  - MCP tools implementation

- [ ] **Bulk Operations**
  - Bulk request updates
  - Bulk task creation
  - Bulk status changes

- [ ] **Advanced Search**
  - Complex query builder
  - Cross-module search
  - Saved searches

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Problem Management Module**
  - Problem creation and tracking
  - Root cause analysis
  - Problem-incident linking

- [ ] **Change Management Module**
  - Change request workflow
  - Approval processes
  - Impact analysis

- [ ] **Reporting & Analytics**
  - Custom report generation
  - Data export (CSV, PDF)
  - Dashboard metrics

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Knowledge Base Integration**
- [ ] **Contract Management**
- [ ] **Vendor Management**
- [ ] **Notification System**
- [ ] **Webhook Support**

## üìä Project Metrics

- **Total MCP Tools:** 21 implemented (8 request + 11 project + 2 user)
- **API Coverage:** ~40% of Service Desk Plus API
- **Code Coverage:** Tests to be implemented
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive
- **Security:** Hardened with pre-commit hooks and sanitization

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Search Endpoint:** SDP doesn't provide a search endpoint, using client-side filtering
2. **Field Naming:** Must use `email_id` instead of `email` for user objects
3. **Close Endpoint:** Direct close endpoint may not work, using update with status instead
4. **Required Fields:** SDP requires many fields for request creation (handled with defaults)

## üîß Technical Debt

1. **Testing:** Need comprehensive test suite
2. **Error Handling:** Could improve error messages for specific scenarios
3. **Performance:** Consider caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Type Safety:** Some areas still use `any` type

## üìÖ Recent Updates

### January 4, 2025
