# Multi-User Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a multi-user solution for the Service Desk Plus MCP server that allows each Claude Code user to provide their own SDP credentials.

## Implementation Approach

Due to limitations in the MCP protocol (which doesn't support passing client-specific environment variables to the server dynamically), we've implemented a practical solution using multiple server instances.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Configuration Files

- **`.mcp.json`** - Updated to show how to configure credentials
- **`.env.claude.example`** - Template for user-specific environment files
- **`start-user-instance.sh`** - Script to start user-specific instances

### 2. Documentation

- **`docs/MULTI_USER_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive guide for multi-user deployments
- **`docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md`** - Detailed Claude Code configuration guide

### 3. Code Files (For Future Use)

- **`src/indexSSEMultiUser.ts`** - Multi-user server implementation (prototype)
- **`src/transport/sse-server-multiuser.ts`** - Enhanced SSE transport
- **`src/utils/sessionManager.ts`** - Session management utilities

## How It Works

### Current Solution: Multiple Instances

Each user runs their own MCP server instance with their credentials:

1. **User creates their environment file**: `.env.username`
2. **User starts their instance**: `./start-user-instance.sh username`
3. **Claude Code connects** to the user's specific instance

### Benefits

- **Complete isolation** between users
- **No credential sharing** or leakage
- **Simple to understand** and troubleshoot
- **Works with current MCP limitations**

### Example Setup

For a user named "alice":

1. Create `.env.alice`:
```env
SDP_CLIENT_ID=alice_client_id
SDP_CLIENT_SECRET=alice_secret
SDP_INSTANCE_NAME=alice-instance
SDP_BASE_URL=https://alice.servicedeskplus.com
SDP_HTTP_PORT=3456
```

2. Start Alice's instance:
```bash
./start-user-instance.sh alice
```

3. Configure Claude Code (`.mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "service-desk-plus": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": ["./start-user-instance.sh", "alice"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. Local Development
- Each developer runs their own instance locally
- Best for individual use

### 2. Docker Containers
- Each user gets a containerized instance
- Good for team environments

### 3. Systemd Services
- Each user has a system service
- Best for production servers

### 4. PM2 Process Manager
- Manage multiple instances easily
- Good for Node.js environments

## Security Considerations

- **Environment files** contain sensitive credentials
- **Use `.gitignore`** to exclude `.env.*` files
- **Set proper permissions** on credential files
- **Use unique API keys** for each instance
- **Implement IP allowlists** for production

## Future Improvements

The prototype multi-user code (`indexSSEMultiUser.ts`) demonstrates how a true multi-user system could work once MCP supports:

- Dynamic credential passing from clients
- Session-based authentication
- Per-session client instances

For now, the multiple instance approach provides the best balance of functionality and security.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.claude.example .env.myname
```

2. Edit with your credentials:
```bash
nano .env.myname
```

3. Start your instance:
```bash
./start-user-instance.sh myname
```

4. Configure Claude Code to use your instance

That's it! Each user can now have their own isolated SDP MCP server instance.
