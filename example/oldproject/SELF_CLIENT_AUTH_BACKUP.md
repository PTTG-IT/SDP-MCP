2. Updated README.md with prominent section about self-client authentication
3. Added plan link to documentation section

## Git Commit
- Commit: 2ed71ec
- Message: "Add comprehensive Self-Client Authentication implementation plan"
- Pushed to: https://github.com/TenKTech/service-desk-plus-mcp.git

## Plan Overview
The self-client authentication model allows remote users to:
- Use only Client ID and Secret in their .mcp.json
- Have the server manage all OAuth token lifecycle
- Store refresh tokens securely in PostgreSQL
- Automatically handle token refresh with rate limiting
- Recover gracefully from failures with circuit breaker

## Implementation Timeline
- Week 1: Core authentication and token persistence
- Week 2: User experience and monitoring  
- Week 3: Testing and documentation
- Week 4: Deployment and migration support

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Use existing `OAuthTokenService` for token management
2. Enhance error messages to guide users through setup
3. Add OAuth initialization endpoint for first-time setup
4. Implement graceful degradation when tokens missing
5. Track all OAuth operations in database for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation (core authentication)
2. Create OAuth setup helper service
3. Enhance error responses with setup instructions
4. Add database schema for tracking auth failures
