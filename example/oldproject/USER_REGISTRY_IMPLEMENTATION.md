# User Registry Implementation Summary

## Overview

The API Key Mapping Service (User Registry) has been successfully implemented to provide simple multi-user access to the Service Desk Plus MCP server. This solution allows Windows users to configure their Claude clients once with a simple API key, while their SDP credentials are stored securely on the server.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Database Schema** (`src/db/migrations/001_user_mappings.sql`)
   - Stores user mappings with encrypted credentials
   - Tracks usage and last access time
   - Supports rate limit overrides per user
   - Includes audit trail functionality

2. **Encryption Module** (`src/utils/encryption.ts`)
   - AES-256-GCM encryption for credential storage
   - SHA-256 hashing for API key lookups
   - Secure API key generation (`usr_` prefix)
   - Validation utilities

3. **UserRegistry Service** (`src/services/userRegistry.ts`)
   - CRUD operations for user management
   - Credential caching for performance
   - Usage tracking
   - Database interaction layer

4. **Enhanced SSE Server** (`src/transport/sse-server.ts`)
   - Modified authentication to support user registry keys
   - Seamless integration with existing auth flow
   - Backward compatible with standard API keys

5. **Registry-Enabled Server** (`src/indexSSEWithRegistry.ts`)
   - Main entry point for user registry mode
   - Initializes all components
   - Manages session-to-client mapping

6. **Admin CLI** (`src/cli/userAdmin.ts`)
   - Command-line tool for user management
   - Interactive prompts for credential input
   - List, create, update, deactivate operations

7. **Setup Script** (`scripts/setup-users.js`)
   - Simplified initial user creation
   - Batch user addition support
   - Generates client configurations

## User Flow

1. **Admin creates user**:
   ```bash
   npm run user:setup
   # Enter user details and SDP credentials
   # Receive API key: usr_2KtY3Bz9F5X8vQ...
   ```

2. **Admin provides configuration to user**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "service-desk-plus": {
         "type": "sse",
         "url": "http://server:3456/sse",
         "headers": {
           "X-API-Key": "usr_2KtY3Bz9F5X8vQ..."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **User connects to server**:
   - Client sends API key in header
   - Server validates key and loads credentials
   - Session established with user's SDP credentials
   - All operations use user's context

## Security Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: All credentials encrypted at rest
- **API Key Hashing**: Keys hashed before storage
- **Session Isolation**: Each user has isolated session
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor access patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user rate limit overrides
- **Audit Trail**: All operations logged

## Implementation Details

### Database Tables

```sql
user_mappings:
- id (primary key)
- api_key (unique, plain text for display)
- api_key_hash (for lookups)
- user_name
- user_email
- encrypted_credentials
- is_active
- created_at, updated_at, last_used_at
- usage_count
- rate_limit_override
- metadata (JSONB)
- notes

user_mapping_usage:
- id (primary key)
- user_mapping_id (foreign key)
- used_at
- ip_address
- user_agent
- request_count
- error_count
```

### Authentication Flow

1. Request arrives with `X-API-Key` header
2. If key starts with `usr_`:
   - Hash the key
   - Look up in database
   - Decrypt credentials
   - Cache for performance
   - Track usage
3. Create session with user's credentials
4. All subsequent operations use those credentials

### Known Limitations

1. **MCP SDK Context**: The SDK doesn't provide session context in tool handlers, limiting per-user features within tools
2. **Credential Updates**: Users must contact admin to update SDP credentials
3. **No Self-Service**: Currently no web interface for users

## Usage Examples

### Adding a User

```bash
npm run user:admin create
# or
npm run user:setup  # For interactive bulk addition
```

### Listing Users

```bash
npm run user:admin list
```

### Updating Credentials

```bash
npm run user:admin update-credentials 123
```

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm run start:registry
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Web Admin Interface**: Browser-based user management
2. **OAuth Flow**: Let users authorize their own credentials
3. **Automatic Rotation**: Periodic credential refresh
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Usage dashboards and reports
5. **Self-Service Portal**: Users manage their own keys

## Migration Path

For existing deployments using standard API keys:

1. Keep `SDP_API_KEYS` during transition
2. Add users gradually to registry
3. Both auth methods work simultaneously
4. Remove standard keys once migrated

## Configuration

See `.env.registry.example` for complete configuration options.

Key requirements:
- PostgreSQL database
- `SDP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
- Database initialized with schema

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Encryption validation on startup
- Database connection testing
- User creation and authentication flow
- Session management verification

Next step is to test multi-user scenarios with real clients.
