# Rate Limit Findings - Service Desk Plus Cloud API

## Summary

After extensive testing, we've discovered that Service Desk Plus Cloud has very aggressive rate limiting that is not well documented.

## Key Findings

### 1. API Behavior
- Error message: "You have made too many requests continuously. Please try again after some time."
- This appears even with conservative rate limiting (20 requests/minute)
- The rate limit seems to be cumulative across a session or time window
- Recovery time appears to be 60-90 seconds minimum

### 2. Current Configuration
```bash
SDP_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=10  # Very conservative
```

### 3. Implemented Solutions

#### Enhanced Rate Limiter
- Per-user tracking for multi-tenant scenarios
- Adaptive rate adjustment based on API responses
- Priority queue system for critical operations
- Automatic backoff when limits detected

#### Request Queue
- Manages concurrent requests
- Prioritizes important operations
- Automatically retries failed requests
- Prevents request flooding

#### Monitoring Tools
- Real-time usage tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Automatic optimization recommendations

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. Use very conservative rate limits (10 req/min)
2. Add significant delays between operations (5-10 seconds)
3. Batch operations where possible
4. Implement comprehensive error handling

### For Production
1. Contact ManageEngine support for official rate limits
2. Request higher rate limits for production use
3. Implement caching to reduce API calls
4. Use webhooks instead of polling where possible

### Code Patterns

#### Safe API Call Pattern
```javascript
async function safeApiCall(operation, client) {
  const stats = client.rateLimiter.getStats();
  
  if (stats.current >= stats.max * 0.8) {
    await wait(stats.resetIn * 1000 + 1000);
  }
  
  try {
    return await operation();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('too many requests')) {
      await wait(60000); // Wait 1 minute
      return await operation(); // Retry once
    }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### Batch Operations
```javascript
// Instead of multiple individual calls
for (const id of projectIds) {
  await client.projects.get(id); // BAD
}

// Use list with filters
const projects = await client.projects.list({
  filter: `id IN (${projectIds.join(',')})` // GOOD
});
```

## Test Scripts Created

All test scripts are in `tests/scripts/` with proper error handling and rate limit monitoring:

1. `find-optimal-rate.js` - Discovers safe rate limits
2. `test-rate-limit.js` - Tests current configuration  
3. `verify-project.js` - Safe project verification
4. `manage-sdp-project.js` - Complete project management

## Current Project Status

Successfully created project ID: `216826000006339009`
- Title: "Service Desk Plus MCP Server Development"
- Status: Created successfully
- Tasks: Creation pending due to rate limits

## Next Steps

1. Wait for rate limit to fully reset (90+ seconds)
2. Use verify-project.js with extended delays
3. Create tasks one at a time with 10+ second delays
4. Document any additional findings

## Long-term Solutions

1. **Implement Caching Layer**
   - Cache project/user data
   - Reduce repeated API calls
   - Implement cache invalidation

2. **Request Batching**
   - Combine multiple operations
   - Use bulk endpoints where available
   - Reduce total request count

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Use webhooks for updates
   - Reduce polling frequency
   - React to changes vs checking

4. **Official Support**
   - Contact ManageEngine
   - Get official rate limit documentation
   - Request production access limits
